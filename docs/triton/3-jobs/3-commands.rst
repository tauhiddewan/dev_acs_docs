Scheduling Jobs
---------------

The command ``bsub`` will submit a job for processing. You must include
the information LSF needs to allocate the resources your job requires,
handle standard I/O streams, and run the job. For more information about
flags, type ``bsub -h`` at the Pegasus prompt. Detailed information can
be displayed with ``man bsub``. On submission, LSF will return the job
id which can be used to keep track of your job.

::

    [username@triton ~]$ bsub -J jobname -o %J.out -e %J.err -q general -P myproject myprogram
    Job <2607> is submitted to general queue .

The Job Scripts section has more information about organizing multiple
flags into a job script file for submission.

Monitoring Jobs
---------------

bjobs
~~~~~

The commands ``bjobs`` displays information about your own pending,
running, and suspended jobs.

::

    [username@triton ~]$ bjobs
    JOBID  USER   STAT  QUEUE    FROM_HOST  EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME  SUBMIT_TIME
    4225   usernam   RUN   general  m1       16*n060     testjob   Mar  2 11:53
                                             16*n061
                                             16*n063
                                             16*n064

For details about your particular job, issue the command
``bjobs -l jobID`` where ``jobID`` is obtained from the ``JOBID`` field
of the above ``bjobs`` output. To display a specific user’s jobs, use
``bjobs -u username``. To display all user jobs in paging format, pipe
output to ``less``:

::

    [username@triton ~]$ bjobs -u all | less
    JOBID     USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME
    5990529   axt651  RUN   interactiv login4.pega n002        bash       Feb 13 15:23
    6010636   zxh69   RUN   general    login4.pega 16*n178     *acsjob-01 Feb 23 11:36
                                                   16*n180
                                                   16*n203
                                                   16*n174
    6014246   swishne RUN   interactiv n002.pegasu n002        bash       Feb 24 14:10
    6017561   asingh  PEND  interactiv login4.pega             matlab     Feb 25 14:49
    ...

bhist
~~~~~

``bhist`` displays information about your recently finished jobs. CPU
time is not normalized in ``bhist`` output. To see your *finished* and
*unfinished* jobs, use ``bhist -a``.

bkill
~~~~~

``bkill`` kills the last job submitted by the user running the command,
by default. The command ``bkill jobID`` will remove a specific job from
the queue and terminate the job **if** it is running. ``bkill 0`` will
kill all jobs belonging to current user.

::

    [username@triton ~]$ bkill 4225
    Job <4225> is being terminated

On Pegasus (Unix), SIGINT and SIGTERM are sent to give the job a chance
to clean up before termination, then SIGKILL is sent to kill the job.

bqueues
~~~~~~~

``bqueues`` displays information about queues such as queue name, queue
priority, queue status, job slot statistics, and job state statistics.
CPU time is normalized by CPU factor.

::

    [username@triton ~]$ bqueues
    QUEUE_NAME      PRIO STATUS          MAX JL/U JL/P JL/H NJOBS  PEND   RUN  SUSP 
    bigmem          500  Open:Active       -   16    -    -  1152  1120    32     0
    normal          100  Open:Active       -    -    -    -  9677  5969  3437     0
    interactive      30  Open:Active       -    4    -    -    13     1    12     0

bhosts
~~~~~~

``bhosts`` displays information about all hosts such as host name, host
status, job state statistics, and jobs lot limits. ``bhosts -s``
displays information about numeric resources (shared or host-based) and
their associated hosts. ``bhosts hostname`` displays information about
an individual host and ``bhosts -w`` displays more detailed host status.
closed_Full means the configured maximum number of running jobs has been
reached (running jobs will not be affected), no new job will be assigned
to this host.

::

    [username@triton ~]$ bhosts -w | less
    HOST_NAME          STATUS       JL/U    MAX  NJOBS    RUN  SSUSP  USUSP    RSV 
    n001               ok              -     16     14     14      0      0      0
    n002               ok              -     16      4      4      0      0      0
    ...
    n342               closed_Full     -     16     16     12      0      0      4
    n343               closed_Full     -     16     16     16      0      0      0
    n344               closed_Full     -     16     16     16      0      0      0

bpeek
~~~~~

Use ``bpeek jobID`` to monitor the progress of a job and identify
errors. If errors are observed, valuable user time and system resources
can be saved by terminating an erroneous job with ``bkill jobID``. By
default, ``bpeek`` displays the standard output and standard error
produced by one of your unfinished jobs, up to the time the command is
invoked. ``bpeek -q queuename`` operates on your most recently submitted
job in that queue and ``bpeek -m hostname`` operates on your most
recently submitted job dispatched to the specified host.
``bpeek -f jobID`` display live outputs from a running job and it can be
terminated by ``Ctrl-C`` (Windows & most Linux) or ``Command-C`` (Mac).

Examining Job Output
--------------------

Once your job has completed, examine the contents of your job’s output
files. Note the script submission under **User input**, whether the job
completed, and the **Resource usage summary**.

::

    [username@triton ~]$ cat test.out
    Sender: LSF System <lsfadmin@n069.triton.edu>
    Subject: Job 6021006: <test> in cluster <mk2> Done
    Job <test> was submitted from host <login4.triton.edu> by user <username> in cluster <mk2>.
    Job was executed on host(s) <8*n069>, in queue <general>, as user <username> in cluster <mk2>.
    ...
    Your job looked like:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    # LSBATCH: User input
    #!/bin/sh
    #BSUB -n 16
    #BSUB -J test
    #BSUB -o test.out
    ...
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Successfully completed.
    Resource usage summary:
    CPU time : 2.26 sec.
    Max Memory : 30 MB
    Average Memory : 30.00 MB
    ...
    PS:
    Read file <test.err> for stderr output of this job.
