SCCC HPC QuickStart Guide
=========================

The purpose of this document is to provide members of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) community with the basic tools necessary to access the High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources at the UM Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC). This guide is designed as a starting point for users new to Pegasus and is intended to act as a reference to supplement the on boarding training required for all users.

If you are submitting the request on behalf of your Lab's PI, please include their CaneID in the form's ``Project Description``.
