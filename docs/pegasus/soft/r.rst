R on Pegasus
============

To run the R programming language on Pegasus, first load an R module
with ``module load R/version``. Use the command ``module avail`` to see
a list of available software, including R versions. For more information
about Pegasus software, see :ref:`Software on the Pegasus
Cluster <p-soft>`.

Batch R
-------

To run a batch R file on Pegasus compute nodes, submit the file to LSF
with ``R CMD BATCH filename.R``. Remember to include the ``-P`` flag and
your project, if you have one.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ module load R/2.15.2
    [username@pegasus ~]$ bsub -q general -P projectID R CMD BATCH example1.R
    Job is submitted to <projectID> project.
    Job <6101046> is submitted to queue <general>.

See ``example1.R`` below. For more information about ``bsub`` and
scheduling jobs, see :ref:`Scheduling Jobs on the Pegasus
Cluster <p-jobs>`.

Batch jobs can also be submitted to LSF with script files.

::

    example.job
    #!/bin/bash
    #BSUB -J R_job            # name of your job
    #BSUB -R "span[hosts=1]"  # request run script on one node
    #BSUB -q general          # request run on general queue
    #BSUB -n 1                # request 1 core
    #BSUB -W 2                # request 2 minutes of runtime
    #BSUB -P projectID        # your projectID
    R CMD BATCH example1.R    # R command and your batch R file



    [username@pegasus ~]$ bsub < example.job

Interactive R
-------------

Load an R module, then submit an interactive R session with
``bsub -Is``. Specify your project with the ``-P`` flag.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ module load R/2.15.2
    [username@pegasus ~]$ bsub -Is -q interactive R
    or
    [username@pegasus ~]$ bsub -Is -P hpc R

R packages
----------

From the R prompt, install any R package to your personal R library with
the standard ``install.package()`` R command. Choose ``y`` when asked
about using a personal library, and ``y`` again if asked to create one.

::

    >  install.packages("doParallel", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
    Warning in install.packages("doParallel", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org") :
      'lib = "/share/opt/R/3.1.2/lib64/R/library"' is not writable
    Would you like to use a personal library instead?  (y/n) y
    Would you like to create a personal library
    ~/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/3.1
    to install packages into?  (y/n) y
    ...

Contact `IDSC ACS <mailto:hpc@ccs.miami.edu>`_ to review any core library pre-requisites & dependencies, for cluster-wide installation.  


R file examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``example1.R``

--------------

.. code:: r

     # create graphical output file
    pdf("example1.pdf")

    # Define two vectors v1 and v2
    v1 <- c(1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12)
    v2 <- c(2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15)

    # Creat some graphs
    hist(v1)
    hist(v2)
    pie(v1)
    barplot(v2)

    # close the file
    dev.off() 

If you have forwarded your display, open the pdf from the Pegasus prompt
with evince.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ evince example1.pdf
