Pegasus user guides
====================

We are planning to perform a system upgrade on the Pegasus cluster to CentOS 7 on **Feb 12th, 2021** at 5pm.  

It is important that you test your software under CentOS 7 prior to the upgrade on Feb 12th, to ensure compatibility in the new environment.   You will find instruction for testing on CentOS 7 below. 

If you encounter issues during testing, let our IDSC cluster support team know via email to `IDSC team (hpc@ccs.miami.edu) <mailto:hpc@ccs.miami.edu>`_ .
